**_Note how all headlines below show an anchor link when you hover them?_**\
That's [gatsby-remark-autolink-headers][5] hooking up all `MarkdownRemark` headers
with anchor links for us.

## Markdown in Gatsby

Markdown parsing in Gatsby is done with [gatsby-transformer-remark][1], which
uses the excellent [remark][2] under the hood.\
Alongside remark we also use [gatsby-remark-smartypants][6], which provides smart
punctuation through [retext-smartypants][7].

The examples on this page cover the basic Markdown syntax and are adapted from
[Markdown Here's Cheatsheet][3] ([CC-BY][4]).
